          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Come election time for the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame, various players,
             commentators and writers, attempt to predict who will and will not gain
             entry. The desire for knowledge about whether or not a player will be inducted comes from multiple angles. Fans want to know if their favorite players are going to make the Hall or not. Writers often write articles predicting the voting outcomes and are judged more favorably if they are consistently accurate. Teams themselves have financial stake in the matter; if a former superstar is inducted, special Hall of Fame jerseys can be sold.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>We have chosen to build a system that, given the lifetime statistics of a Major League Baseball position player, predicts whether or not that position player will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.</strong> To do this, our learner uses past player statistics (obtained from <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com">Fangraphs</a>) to create Gaussian distribution functions for both Hall of Famers and non-Hall of Famers. The fewer players that our system misclassifies, the better it has become.

          <h2>Data Set</h2>
          <p>We obtained our data set from <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com">Fangraphs</a>, a website that keeps advanced baseball statistics. <strong>Our data set contains career statistics of every player that played any part of his major league career between the years 1974 and 1985, inclusive.</strong> The data we used contains 15 statistics in particular: G, PA, HR, R, RBI, SB, ISO, BABIP, AVG, OBP, SLG, wOBA, wRC+, BsR, and WAR (definitions for all of which can be found at the <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/library/">Fangraphs Library Stat Glossary</a>). In total, this data set contains data for 483 players, 29 of whom are in the Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>The reason for the selection of these particular years (1974-1984) is a pragmatic one. A player with a long career that ended in 1974 began his career in the late 1950s or later. If we included earlier players, their statistics, very different because of how far removed from the present it is, would change the model in a negative way. A player whose career began in 1984, would have a career that ended by the early 2000s and is therefore 10 years removed from playing, and therefore eligble for the Hall of Fame, per the Baseball Writers' Association of America's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/brettbushthesis/chapter-2/major-league-baseball-hall-of-fame-entrance-qualifications">Hall of Fame elibility rules.</a></p>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="span6">
          
          <p>Our system works in two parts, training and validation. To train, it takes players with known classifications, some in the Hall of Fame class, others in the non-Hall of Fame class, whom we will refer to as Hall of Famers and Scrubs, respectively. We choose some of the above statistics on which we want to train, which could be some or all of them. The training data is split between the classes and the mean and covariance matrix of the desired statistics are computed. <strong>Finally, for each class, a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution function is created.</strong></p>

          <p>To validate, a separate set of players is supplied. The players statistics are plugged into the Gaussian distribution functions for each classification. Using both functions, if we find that the probability of a player belonging to the HOF class is greater than the probability of him belonging to the Scrub class then he is classified as a Hall-of-Famer, otherwise he is a Scrub.</p>

          <p>The baseline approach against which we compare our system is the assumption that the probability of a player making the Hall of Fame is .062 (or the proportion of Hall-of-Famers in our training set) and the probability of a player not making the Hall of Fame is therefore .938. The baseline will classify a player based on which probability is greateer meaning it will classify every player as a Scrub and will have an error rate of .062.</p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p><strong>Thus far, we have determined that our system is about as accurate as using the baseline approach if we use advanced metrics</strong> and worse if we use typical metrics. For instance, when we create our Gaussian models using HR and RBI, we obtain an average error rate of .137. When using the advanced metrics of wOBA, wRC+, and WAR, we obtain an average error rate of approximately .066, very similar to the baseline error rate of .062. Interestingly enough, the "triple crown" of AVG, HR and RBI performed very poorly with an error rate of .127.
