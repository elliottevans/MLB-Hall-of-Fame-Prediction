      <h1>MLB Hall of Fame Predictor</h1>
      
      <div id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Come election time for the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame, various players,
           commentators, and writers, attempt to predict who will and will not gain
           entry. We have chosen to build a system that, given the lifetime
           statistics of a Major League Baseball position player, predicts whether
           or not that position player will be inducted into the Hall of Fame. We construct
           two Gaussian models: one that is representative of Hall of Famers and another
           that is representative of players not in the Hall of Fame. We studied 15 offensive
           statistics in particular: G, PA, HR, R, RBI, SB, ISO, BABIP, AVG, OBP, SLG, wOBA,
           wRC+, BsR, and WAR. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We utilized multi-dimensional Gaussians to model our Hall of Fame class and our 
           non-Hall of Fame class, which we will call the "Scrub" class. We trained our system
           on data from the years 1974-1984 (this is intuitive since you need at least 10
           years of retirement to be eligible for the HOF). Once we created our training set,
           we performed 3-fold cross validation and proceeded to divide up the training sets
           into Hall-of-Famers and Scrubs, from which we based our Gaussian models. Using both
           models, if we find that the probability of a player belonging to the HOF class is 
           greater than the probability of him belonging to the Scrub class then he is classified
           as a Hall-of-Famer, otherwise he is a Scrub. Thus, the error measure for our model is 
           the number of missclassifications on the validation sets. The baseline approach against
           which we will compare our system is the assumption that the probability of a player 
           making the Hall of Fame is .062 (or the proportion of Hall-of-Famers in our training
           set). The baseline will then proceed to classify every player as a Scrub and will have
           an error rate of .062.

      <div id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Thusfar, we have determined that our system is about as accurate as using the
           baseline approach if we use advanced metrics and worse if we use typical metrics. 
           For instance, when we create our Gaussian models using HR and RBI,
           we obtain an average error rate of .137. When using the advanced metrics of wOBA, wRC+, and WAR,
           we obtain an average error rate of approximately .066, very similar to the baseline error
           rate of .062. Interestingly enough, the "triple crown" statistics performed very poorly
           with an error rate of .127
